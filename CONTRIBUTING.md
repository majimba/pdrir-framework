# Contributing to PDRIR Docs

Thanks for improving the PDRIR Framework documentation!

## How to contribute

- Propose changes via Issues/PRs. Keep PRs small and focused.
- Maintain the structure:
  - Core chapters live in ./core and are numbered 01â€“09.
  - Supporting methodology guides live in ./guides.
- Prefer concise, actionable writing. Use headings and short lists.

## Style and linting

- One H1 per file, at the top.
- Leave one blank line before/after headings and around lists.
- End files with a single trailing newline.
- Keep links relative; prefer [Back to Home](../index.md) in subfolders.

## Templates

Use files under ./templates for common artifacts:
- problem-statement.md
- deconstruction-truths.md
- research-log.md
- implementation-checklist.md
- refinement-retro.md

## Review checklist

- Does this improve clarity for a new reader?
- Are links valid and paths correct?
- Are examples minimal but runnable in concept?
- Is the change aligned with PDRIR phases and terminology?
