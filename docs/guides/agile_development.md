# Agile and Lean Development: A Practical Guide

Deliver value fast, learn from feedback, and iterate with discipline and focus.

## What it is

Agile is a set of values and practices that favor working software, collaboration, and responsiveness to change. Lean emphasizes removing waste and maximizing flow of value. Together, they promote small, testable increments and continuous improvement.

## Core practices

- Small batches: Ship minimal increments that demonstrate value.
- Iterations: Timeboxed cycles with clear goals and reviews.
- Backlog & prioritization: Ruthless focus on highest-impact work.
- Definition of Done: Shared criteria for completion and quality.
- Feedback loops: Demos, retrospectives, and metrics to guide change.
- Technical excellence: Testing, CI, refactoring to keep velocity sustainable.

## How it supports PDRIR

- P (Problem): Keeps the MVP tight and outcome-focused.
- D (Deconstruction): Splits work into small, independently testable slices.
- R (Research): Timeboxes spikes; validates options quickly.
- I (Implementation): Iterative delivery with CI and automation.
- R (Refinement): Retrospectives and metrics drive continuous improvement.

## Quick checklist

- What is the smallest slice that delivers observable value?
- What will we demo at the end of this iteration?
- What is our Definition of Done (tests, docs, review, deploy)?
- Which 1–2 metrics indicate we’re improving?

## Common pitfalls

- Waterfall in disguise (big up-front plans, late demos).
- Overcommitting; skipping tests and refactoring.
- Too many WIP items; context switching kills flow.

- TODO: Add links to methodology guides, team working agreements, and metrics.
