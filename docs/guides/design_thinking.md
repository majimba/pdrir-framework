# Design Thinking: A Practical Guide

A concise, human-centered method for understanding users, reframing problems, and iteratively testing solutions.

## What it is

Design Thinking is an iterative approach that prioritizes user needs, rapid learning, and continuous refinement. It balances desirability (user value), feasibility (technical viability), and viability (business sustainability).

## The Five Phases

- Empathize: Study users in context; interview, observe, collect pain points.
- Define: Synthesize insights into a sharp problem statement (POV) and success criteria.
- Ideate: Generate many solutions; defer judgment; explore breadth before depth.
- Prototype: Build the smallest artifact that tests a key assumption.
- Test: Put prototypes in front of users; capture signals; refine the POV and design.

Note: Phases are non-linear—expect to loop and revisit earlier steps as you learn.

## How it supports PDRIR

- P (Problem): Primary driver—craft the problem statement and MVP criteria.
- D (Deconstruction): Clarifies constraints and user truths from research.
- R (Research): Guides what data to gather from users and how.
- I (Implementation): Focuses scope on user value first.
- R (Refinement): Validates improvements with users; close the feedback loop.

## Quick checklist

- Have we talked to at least 3 target users? What surprised us?
- Can we state the problem from the user’s perspective in one sentence?
- What’s the smallest testable prototype to validate value?
- What did our last test change about our problem framing?

## Common pitfalls

- Solution-first thinking; skipping user discovery.
- Over-polishing prototypes; delaying learning.
- Testing with non-representative users.
