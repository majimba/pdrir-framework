# Systems Thinking: A Practical Guide

Understand and design whole systems by focusing on relationships, flows, and feedback, not just components.

## What it is

Systems Thinking is a holistic approach that studies how parts interact to produce behavior over time. It emphasizes boundaries, stocks and flows, delays, feedback loops (reinforcing and balancing), and emergent outcomes.

## Core concepts

- Elements and boundaries: Define what’s inside/outside the system; avoid scope creep.
- Stocks and flows: Quantities that accumulate (stocks) and the rates that change them (flows).
- Feedback loops:
  - Reinforcing (R): Amplify change (growth/decline).
  - Balancing (B): Resist change (stability/targets).
- Delays: Gaps between action and effect; source of oscillations.
- Leverage points: Small changes that produce large, lasting effects.

## How it supports PDRIR

- P (Problem): Sets system boundary and outcome measures.
- D (Deconstruction): Identifies key stocks, flows, and feedbacks to address.
- R (Research): Targets tools/techniques that fit the system’s constraints.
- I (Implementation): Guides data flow, module boundaries, and event handling.
- R (Refinement): Observes runtime behavior; adjusts loops, thresholds, and delays.

## Quick checklist

- What is the system boundary? Who/what is outside it but influences it?
- Which variables accumulate? What increases/decreases them?
- Where are the strongest feedback loops? Are they R or B?
- What delays could cause overshoot or oscillation?
- Where are 1–2 leverage points for the MVP?

## Common pitfalls

- Optimizing parts at the expense of the whole.
- Ignoring delays; misattributing causes to the wrong actions.
- Overcomplicating models; forgetting parsimony.
