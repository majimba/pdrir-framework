## What is PDRIR?

PDRIR is a five-phase methodology for turning ideas into functional, well-engineered projects:
Problem, Deconstruction, Research, Implementation, and Refinement. It blends principles from
[Design Thinking](./guides/design_thinking.md), [First-Principles Thinking](./guides/first_principles_thinking.md),
[Systems Thinking](./guides/systems_thinking.md), and [Agile Development](./guides/agile_development.md).

## Quick start

- Read Core Philosophy to understand the mindset and pillars.
- Work through the five phases (P → D → R → I → R).
- Try the Clip-Keeper follow-along project to practice the loop.
