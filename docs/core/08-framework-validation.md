# 08. Framework Validation: Applying PDRIR to Itself

[Back to Home](../index.md)

## Phase 1: Problem (Validation)

Problem Statement: "As an aspiring developer, I am trying to build useful projects, but I am frustrated by a lack of clear process, which causes me to get overwhelmed and abandon my ideas."

MVP Success Criteria: A framework that provides a step-by-step process from idea to functioning MVP.

## Phase 2: Deconstruction (Validation)

- Truth 1: A user must first understand the problem they are solving (The 'Why').
- Truth 2: A user must break the problem into its smallest technical parts (The 'What').
- Truth 3: A user must find the tools to solve each part (The 'How').
- Truth 4: A user must assemble the solutions into a working whole (The 'Do').
- Truth 5: A user must have a process for improving the working whole (The 'Iterate').

## Phase 3: Research (Validation)

Search: "problem solving methodologies", "software development lifecycle", "how to break down problems", "user-centered design".

Results: This research leads directly to the foundational pillars: [Design Thinking](../guides/design_thinking.md) (Truth 1), [First-Principles](../guides/first_principles_thinking.md)/Decomposition (Truth 2), [Agile/Lean](../guides/agile_development.md) (Truth 4 & 5), and standard research practices (Truth 3).

## Phase 4: Implementation (Validation)

Assemble the findings into a named, five-stage process: Problem, Deconstruction, Research, Implementation, Refinement. Write the documentation for it.

## Phase 5: Refinement (Validation)

Problem: The framework is just a theory. It needs a practical example to be credible.

New PDRIR Cycle: Use the framework to build a real-world tool (like the 'Clip-Keeper') and document the process as a tutorial within the main documentation. This makes the framework more robust, understandable, and useful.

The test is successful. The framework is self-consistent and its creation follows its own logic.
