# 02. Phase 1: Problem (The 'Why')

[Back to Home](../index.md)

Core Principle: Define the user and their pain point with absolute clarity.

This phase is pure [Design Thinking](../guides/design_thinking.md). Before touching a line of code, you must become a user-centric designer.

## Process

- Identify a Personal Annoyance: The best initial projects solve your own problems.
  - Bad: "I want to learn about APIs."
  - Good: "I waste 10 minutes every morning checking three different websites for the weather, my top news headlines, and my calendar. I want a single dashboard."
- Write a Formal Problem Statement: Frame it from the user's perspective.
  - "As a [user type], I am trying to [achieve a goal], but I am frustrated by [obstacle] which causes [negative impact]."

## Example

- "As a busy student, I am trying to keep track of useful code snippets and links I find online, but I am frustrated by pasting them into a single messy text file, which causes me to lose track of them or spend too much time searching for what I need."

## MVP Success Criteria

What is the absolute minimum for this to be considered a "win"? This must be a testable outcome.

Example MVP:

- "The tool will allow me to: (1) Press a hotkey to save whatever is currently on my clipboard. (2) See a list of all saved items. (3) Click an item from the list to copy it back to my clipboard."

## Output

A clear, concise mission document outlining the problem and the minimum success criteria.
