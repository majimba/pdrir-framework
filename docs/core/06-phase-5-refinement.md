# 06. Phase 5: Refinement (The 'Iterate')

[Back to Home](../index.md)

Core Principle: Use your own tool and apply the PDRIR loop again to each new idea or problem.

This phase is what separates a one-off script from a real tool. You now become your first user and start the cycle over, but on a smaller scale.

## Process

Use your tool for a day. What annoys you? What could be better? Each answer is a new mini-PDRIR cycle.

### Example idea: Persistence

"The list gets cleared every time I close the program. I want it to be persistent."

- P(roblem): Data is not saved between sessions.
- D(econstruct): The program must write the list of clips to a file on close. It must read that file on startup.
- R(esearch): "python save list to json file", "tkinter on window close event".
- I(mplement): Add the file-saving and file-loading logic.
- R(efine): What if the file is corrupted? Add a try...except block.

### Example idea: Truncated display

"I can't tell which clip is which. I want to see only the first 30 characters."

- P(roblem): Long clips make the UI messy.
- D(econstruct): When displaying the list, each item must be truncated to a fixed length.
- R(esearch): "python string slicing".
- I(mplement): In your GUI display loop, change item to item[:30] + '...'.
- R(efine): What if the item is less than 30 characters? The ... is unnecessary. Add an if statement.

## Output

An improved, more robust, and more feature-rich version (V1.1, V1.2, etc.) of your tool. You are now in a continuous improvement loop.
